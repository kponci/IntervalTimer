# Interval Timer

In my application, it is possible to create, edit, and run interval timers. An interval timer consists of a sequence of simple timers. The application is divided into three sections: Run, Edit, Others. Users are able to switch between these pages using the top navigation. 

## Run page
On the Run page, there is all the information regarding the name of the interval timer, the name of the currently running simple timer, the total remaining time, the elapsed time, and the name of the next simple timer in the sequence. The page also includes buttons to start/stop the timer and to move back/forward to the previous/next simple timer, or move back/forward by 10 seconds.

## Edit page
On the Edit page, there will is an option to add simple timers and rearrange their order. There are also options to edit the name and time of each simple timer.

## Others page
On the Others page, all other interval timers that the user has created are displayed. Users have the ability to edit their names, copy them, and delete them.
